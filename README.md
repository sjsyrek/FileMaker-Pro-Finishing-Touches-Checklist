# FileMaker Pro Finishing Touches Checklist

The first few times I worked with FileMaker Pro, I realized the application grants control of so many details that I would want to take advantage of them allâ€”but would also inevitably end up forgetting a few. The perfectionist's curse! So I put together a list of every detail a database designer ought to consider worrying about once the bigger picture work is done. These tasks range from important to trivial, but they're all equally easy to overlook. They are in no particular order.

- Adjust column widths and modify field visibility in Table View for each Layout that makes it available.
- Set final tab orders on all Layouts.
- Turn off visual spell-checking on fields where it isn't applicable.
- Make sure email addresses and zip codes are validated by calculation.
- Add value lists for states and countries, and use them for field validation and autocompletion.
- Set controls for fields that use value lists for data to appear as pop-ups (short lists) or drop-downs (long lists). Set these fields to show arrows.
- Set long text fields to display a vertical scroll bar.
- Set container fields to reference external files.
- Set conditional formatting on fields where you want this effect.
- Create image placeholder merge fields for containers (e.g. "Drag image here").
- Add a tooltip to every field for which it is even remotely conceivable that someone might need one.
- Set data formatting of fields, as appropriate (e.g. currency, percentages, etc.).
- Write helpful custom messages to display when validation fails for all fields with validation turned on.
- For container fields that display images, select whether to crop or resize the images.
- Set autosizing to expand and contract Layouts and elements reasonably. Set portals to add new rows as the window expands vertically.
- Add field sliding to print previews.
- Decide whether to use popover buttons to display larger images or documents in container fields.
- Set fields to autocomplete using existing values, where applicable.
- Choose objects to hide in certain circumstances and specify calculations for determining when to do so.
- Set whether field entry is available in Browse mode and/or Find mode and whether to select enter field contents on entry.
- For each object, choose whether you can go to the next object using tab, enter, and/or return.
- Create custom menus and menu sets and decide which Layouts should display which menus.
- Create privilege sets.
- Create user accounts and set them up with the appropriate privilege sets.
- Add merge symbols where it might be nice to have them.
- Don't forget about slowly-changing dimensions.
